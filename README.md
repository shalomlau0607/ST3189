Project for Machine Learning, Container Pre-Marshalling Problem(CPMP) and Blood Tranfusion Service Centre Problem(BD)

There are 2 main problems for this project, and the CPMP is a regression problem while the BD is a classification problem. Analysing the CPMP database was to try to make the process of retrieving containers more efficient, affecting maritime transport which is important for international trading. While analysing the BD database was to predict and track if donors would donate blood again in the future, affecting the blood bank supply.
